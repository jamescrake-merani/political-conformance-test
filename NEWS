** Renamed the =political-conformance-test= script to =pct= so it is easier, and faster to type.
** The =pct= script now has exception handling for when the target file cannot be loaded. An error is printed when this is the case.
** The interactive module now validates user input rather than blindingly accepting it.
** Percentages are now rounded.
** Interactive console does not output a percentage with any decimal places.
** The yes, and no response strings are posistioned as they should be because previously, responding no resulted in full agreement being registered despite the opposite being the case in such a situation.
** The =pct= script is no longer auto-compiled.
